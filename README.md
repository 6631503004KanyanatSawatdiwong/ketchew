2. Type a task and press **Enter** or click **Add**
3. Click checkboxes to mark tasks complete
4. Use edit/delete icons for task management
5. Progress bar shows completion percentage

### Notes

## Development Notes

### MVP Limitations
- Audio playback simulated (console logs) - Howler.js integration pending
- External image URLs may require CORS handling in production
- Session storage used for notes (temporary by design)

### Production Roadiness
- All React components are TypeScript-ready
- TailwindCSS provides responsive design
- LocalStorage ensures data persistence
- Modular architecture supports easy feature additions

### Next Steps for Full Version
1. Integrate Howler.js for actual audio playback
2. Add real-time collaboration features with Socket.io backend
3. Implement user authentication and cloud data sync
4. Add more background and sound options
5. Enhanced timer statistics and progress tracking

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Storage**: LocalStorage (persistent) + SessionStorage (temporary)
- **Bundler**: Vite
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom component classes
